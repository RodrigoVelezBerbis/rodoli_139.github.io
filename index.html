        <p>I went with my girlfriend to Africa. Why? we earn a trip to Africa in a raffle in our city. The trip was wonderful, the landscapes, animals, small tribes and their cultures, animals... 
            <br><br>
            The last day my girlfriend and I went to take photos to animals, my priority was a photo with a lion or a tiger, but finally I couldn't archieve it. But in a moment we found a cheeta resting under a tree. I thing that is one of my best photographs in the world.
